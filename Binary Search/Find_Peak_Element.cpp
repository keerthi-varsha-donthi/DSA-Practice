/*
Problem: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

// ---------------- Optimal Approach ----------------

/*
Intuition: If the middle element is less than its right neighbor, then there must be a peak element on the right side of the middle element. Otherwise, there must be a peak element on the left side of the middle element.

Approach: 
1. Initialize left=0 and right=nums.size()-1.
2. While left<right:
    - Compute mid.
    - If nums[mid]<nums[mid+1], move to the right half: left=mid+1.
    - Else, move to the left half: right=mid.
3. When left==right, a peak element has been found.
4. Return left (or right).

Time Complexity: O(log n) due to binary search.

Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using only constant extra space.
